# NS2 Wireless Network
Computer Assignment #2, Computer Networks Course, University of Tehran

The purpose of this assignment is to get acquainted with the NS2 simulation tool and to analyze some network parameters when using a wireless network.

In this computer assignment, we simulate the wireless connection of 9 nodes, including two sender nodes (A and D) and two receiver nodes (L and H). We use 802.11 protocol which will decide some attributes of our WLAN implementation and ways for MAC (Media Access Control) with some protocols for physical layers.
